2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oGreen_reg[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oGreen_reg[1]/CLR,
design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oGreen_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oGreen_reg[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oGreen_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oRed_reg[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/mainPattern_0/inst/r_oRed_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
